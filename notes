analyze:
    the append function is much faster and scales a whole lot better than the intert function. 
    insert uses unshift while append uses push which is a much better way of doing things

extra credit: from what I've read unshift has to increment every single element that is already in the array making it slower especially as the array grows.
 While push can just insert something into the end of an array.
